ProcessWire Form Builder Changelog

Please note: We are soon deprecating support for ProcessWire 2.7.x
and earlier. This version of FormBuilder still supports 2.7.x
but future versions may require PW 3.x going forward.

Update #34 (0.3.4) - 2018/06/08 
===============================

- New email files as attachments option. Now you can optionally 
  configure your forms to add user uploaded files as attachments 
  to the email that gets sent to the administrator. This option 
  is found under the Actions tab when editing a form, in the 
  "Send email to administrators" fieldset, field: "How to handle 
  uploaded files?" 

- Added support for automatically deleting form submissions (entries) 
  from the server, after a specific number of days. The option can 
  be found on the Actions tab when editing a form, in the "Save to 
  entries database" fieldset, field: "Automatically delete entries 
  after how many days?". Maintenance runs twice per day. 

- Multi-language options are now available for Select, Checkboxes, 
  Radios and AsmSelect Inputfields, as well as any others that extend 
  them. NOTE: Requires ProcessWire 3.0.105 or newer to use this.
  
- Improved drop-down menus in Setup > Forms, now lets you drill down 
  directly to form-specific entries or editor.   
  
- The main form list (and dropdown) now show when the last form entry 
  was received for each form.  
  
- Support for form-specific email-administrator.php or 
  email-autoresponder.php template files.   
  
- New "markdown" and "html" options for defining your success message 
  in the form editor.   
  
- New option to specify multiple auto-responder fields (fields 
  containing email address to send auto-responder to).   
  
- The email-administrator.php and email-autoresponder.php template 
  files now also receive a $formBuilderEmail variable which is an 
  instance of the FormBuilderEmail object.   
  
- Added ability to edit the <iframe> tag that FormBuilder uses for 
  embed methods A and B. It is editable in the FormBuilder module 
  configuration “Output” fieldset. In addition, this enables you 
  to do things like force it to always load forms from HTTPS, or 
  use URL without scheme/host if you prefer it.   

- The $forms->load($formName); now also accepts boolean true as 
  $formName, which will make it return all forms (in an array) 
  rather than just one.  
  
- Several new hooks have been added to the form rendering, processing 
  and saving events.   
  
- New README-HOOKS.txt file added which documents FormBuilder's 
  hooks and contains HOW-TO and REFERENCE sections. 

- Various improvements throughout to improve appearance and UI and 
  AdminThemeUikit. 

- Visual improvements to FormBuilder module configuration screen.

- Add new checkbox on Settings tab enabling you to disable session tracking and
  CSRF protection. This is useful if you want to cache your forms with ProCache
  or if you want to send form submissions to a 3rd party script. 
- Optimizations and improvements to the 'plain2' theme

Update #19 - 2012/12/06
=======================

- Fix bug with file uploads that prevented them from working when the files field
  was placed in a Fieldset. Also made the mail() function recognize the $config
  variable: $config->phpMailAdditionalParameters, where you may specify additional
  parameters to FormBuilder's usage of PHP's mail() function, if necessary. This
  would be set from your /site/config.php. 

Update #18 - 2012/11/22
=======================

- Add support for form-level access control. To enable, check the Access Control box
  on your Modules > Form Builder module config screen. This update also installs a
  permission called form-builder-add, which is the permission you would assign to 
  roles you want to be allowed to add new forms. 

Update #17 - 2012/11/12
=======================

- Addition of File Inputfield, specific to use with Form Builder. Various other minor
  bugfixes and tweaks were made as well. 

Update #16 - 2012/10/10
=======================

- Add new option that lets the form be preset with values from GET variables. To enable
  check the box under the 'settings' tab of your form. Once you do that, any GET variables
  present that carry the same name as a form field will be populated to the form. This 
  works with all embed methods and FormBuilder takes care of delivering the data to the
  embed methods that use iframes.

Update #15 - 2012/10/05
=======================

- Add new auto-responder feature

Update #14 - 2012/10/03
=======================

- Add new form submission action: Save to ProcessWire Pages
- Add new 'Actions' and 'Output' tabs in the form admin screen
- Add new CSV delimiter option to the Form Builder config
- Various minor bug fixes 

Update #13 - 2012/09/23
=======================

- Add support for a 'notes' field that appears below the input. This is essentially the same 
  as the 'description' field, except that it appears below, rather than above, the input. 
  You'll see this 'notes' field used throughout ProcessWire already, so this just lets Form 
  Builder use this existing feature.

- Updated the 'Markup' inputfield (InputfieldMarkup) to be usable with Form Builder. To take 
  advantage of this, you'll have to grab the latest ProcessWire core (2.2.9). If you don't 
  have 'Markup' listed as an input type when creating a field in Form Builder, then go to the 
  module settings and add it to the list of allowed inputs.

Update #12 - 2012/09/20
=======================

- Correct issue with possible field name/form setting clashes (i.e. naming a field 'honeypot')

Update #11 - 2012/09/20
=======================

- Correct issues with single Checkbox fields.
- Updated required ProcessWire version to 2.2.8
- Removed redundant error messages from the top of a failed form submission.

Update #10 - 2012/09/18
=======================
	
- First release of Form Builder
