ProcessWire ProFields: Auto Links Textformatter
===============================================

This is a commercially supported module, please do not distribute. 


WHAT IT DOES
------------

This Textformatter module automatically links your specified phrases/words
to your specified URLs. This is an excellent SEO and accessibility tool for
creating automatic contextual links with little effort. If there are pages
that you commonly link to in your site from your textarea/rich text fields,
then this Textformatter can save you a lot of effort, automatically linking
to those URLs. Furthermore, contextual links of this sort are also 
considered especially valueable from an SEO context.

Because this module is a Textformatter module, the work it does happens at
runtime. That means that this module can easily be applied to existing 
sites, no matter how large. 


USAGE EXAMPLE
-------------

We'll use processwire.com as an example. Throughout processwire.com, we 
routinely use the terms "API", "selector", "template", "template file", 
"$page", "$pages" and more. In the past, I've spent a lot of time in 
TinyMCE manually linking these terms to the appropriate pages, as it is 
a helpful cross-reference for users. For example, when the term "API" 
appears, I want to automatically link to the API Cheatsheet page at 
http://cheatsheet.processwire.com. 

With the Auto Links Textformatter module, I can now automatically link to
all my important terms from all existing and future body copy. If one of
those links happens to change in the future, no problem, as I only have
to update it in one place. The benefits here are a real win-win for the
users of processwire.com, myself (in time savings) and our performance
with search engines that analyze these contextual links. We hope that you
find Auto Links to be a huge benefit to your site(s) and time saver for
you and/or your site editors. 


HOW TO INSTALL AND USE
----------------------

1. Copy all the files in this directory to /site/modules/TextformatterAutoLinks/ 

2. In your admin, go to Modules > Check for new modules. 

3. Click the "Install" button next to TextformatterAutolinks

4. This module is configured from its modules screen. Click to edit the 
   Textformatter > AutoLinks module you just installed. You will now see
   a configuration screen asking you to define your auto links. Follow the
   on-screen instructions to complete this step. Or if you prefer, you can
   come back and do this later. 

5. Determine which Textarea fields you want Auto Links to be inserted. 
   Locate those fields in Setup > Fields and edit them. The most likely 
   scenario is that you would apply it to just your "body" field. When
   editing your field, go to the "Details" tab and select "Auto Links 
   Textformatter" from the "Textformatters" select box. If you have other 
   Textformatters selected, you may wish to make Auto Links the last one 
   in the list by dragging and dropping as needed. Save. 

6. Test out your Auto Links by viewing a page that contains the terms.
